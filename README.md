# Car Rental - üöó

This project is a web application designed to streamline car rental and management operations for a car rental company based in Australia. The system enables users to rent cars efficiently while providing administrators with tools to manage inventory and rental requests.

## üöÄ Overview
The system provides a seamless experience for both users and administrators, featuring the following capabilities:

- **For Users**:
  - Sign up, log in, recover password, and log out.
  - Browse a catalog of available cars with detailed descriptions and images.
  - Submit rental requests with required document uploads.
  - Access a historical list of previous rental requests.

- **For Administrators**:
  - Add, edit, delete, and manage car listings, including uploading car images.
  - Review, approve, or reject rental requests based on user-provided documents.
  - View the complete history of users' rental requests.

- **Payment Integration**:
  - Use of the Stellar Network for secure cryptocurrency payments in USDC.
  - Real-time conversion check to ensure users have sufficient funds before completing transactions.

## üì¶ Tech Stack
This PoC leverages modern web development technologies and tools:
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript and Tailwind UI.
- **Backend**: NestJS with TypeScript.
- **Database**: MySQL.
- **Infrastructure**:
  - **AWS S3**: For storing car images and user-uploaded documents.
  - **AWS Cognito**: For secure authentication and authorization.
  - **LocalStack**: To emulate AWS services during development.

## üìë System Architecture
The application has a modular design to separate responsibilities between users, administrators, rentals, and car management. The system architecture includes:

- **Frontend**: A responsive web interface built with React.
- **Backend**: A RESTful API built with NestJS for handling requests and managing data.
- **Database**: MySQL for data storage, including users, cars, and rental requests.
- **File Storage**: AWS S3 for managing user-uploaded documents and car images.

# Installation and Configuration of External Services for Rent a Car

This project requires several external services to function in a development environment. Here you will find the steps to install and run them using Docker.

## **1. Prerequisites**
Before starting, make sure you have installed:

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) (Windows/macOS) or Docker Engine (Linux).
- Docker Compose (included in Docker Desktop or install manually on Linux with:
  ```sh
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install docker.io docker-compose
  ```
- Verify the installation by running:
  ```sh
  docker --version
  docker-compose --version
  ```

## **2. Clone the Repository and Configure Docker Compose**

Clone the backend repository where the `docker-compose.yml` file is located:
```sh
git clone <REPOSITORY_URL>
cd <REPOSITORY_NAME>
```

## **3. Download and Run the Services**

To ensure you are using the latest versions of the containers, first download the required images:
```sh
docker-compose pull
```

Then, start the services in the background:
```sh
docker-compose up -d
```
This will start the following services:
- Cognito Local on port `9229`
- MinIO on ports `9000` and `9001`
- Redis on port `6379`

## **4. Verify that the Services Are Running**
Run:
```sh
docker ps
```
You should see the `cognito-local`, `minio`, and `redis` containers running.

To stop the services:
```sh
docker-compose down
```

## **5. Access the Services**
- **MinIO Web UI:** [http://localhost:9001](http://localhost:9001) (user: `minioadmin`, password: `minioadmin`)
- **Cognito Local:** [http://localhost:9229](http://localhost:9229)
- **Redis:** Does not have a graphical interface, but you can connect from the backend application.

---
Now you can continue with the backend configuration and test the integration with these services. üöÄ
